# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.5] — 2026-04-19 — Gitignore hardening for credentials + local DBs

### Fixed
- `.gitignore` — explicitly ignore credential/secret patterns that could have been staged accidentally: `.env.*` (except `.env.example`), `credentials.json`, `token.json`, `token.pickle`, `client_secret*.json`. Also ignore `*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3` so local SQLite files never get committed.

### Why
This project handles Gmail OAuth tokens and Google API credentials. A leaked `token.pickle` or `client_secret.json` in a public commit would be a real security incident; paranoid gitignore is cheap insurance.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-04-11
### Added
- `memory/issues_log.jsonl` — initialized for the cross-project self-healing system; receives eval pass/fail entries and known-issue patterns from `/post-task-eval` and `/self-heal` skills

## [0.4.3] — 2026-04-07
### Fixed
- Telegram Markdown parse errors in daily digest: added plain-text fallback that strips `*`, `_`, `` ` `` when Markdown send fails
